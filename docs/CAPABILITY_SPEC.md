# MoorAI — Capability Spec

**Version:** 0.6 · **Status:** architecture locked, refining capabilities · **UI language:** English (LTR)

## What it is

MoorAI is a **native desktop "Managed AI Host"** for office workers, paired with a **central
server** for policy and visibility. The employee does their AI work *inside* MoorAI — a native
app with an embedded, managed webview — so the host sees every prompt, response, paste, and
upload natively (no browser extension, no DOM hacks). It detects the 66-threat matrix in real
time, **coaches the employee** with the matrix's guidance, and **reports redacted alerts** to a
central server so the security team has visibility.

**Posture: adoption is voluntary; enforcement is policy-driven.** Adoption is opt-in
(self-install), but MoorAI does block. `threatActionFor` in [`cli/hook-core.mjs`](../cli/hook-core.mjs)
resolves every threat to one of `notify` · `justify` · `block` · `kill`, and
[`cli/moorai-hook.mjs`](../cli/moorai-hook.mjs) turns those into real Claude Code `allow`/`ask`/`deny`
verdicts — up to terminating the session outright (`killSession`). The **default is report-first**:
an unconfigured threat resolves to `notify`, so a finding is reported rather than blocked unless an
admin escalates it via `threatPolicy` / `tierPolicy` (six threats — 11, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49 — default
to `justify` instead). Central distributes the policy that selects those actions. MoorAI's value is
(a) **coaching** the employees who use it, (b) giving the security team **visibility** into AI-usage
risk, and (c) **deterministic prevention** where policy calls for it. Because adoption is voluntary,
it still does not prevent Shadow AI by construction; it reduces risk for those who opt in and
surfaces organization-wide risk signals.

- **Rule-base:** [`data/threats.json`](../data/threats.json) — 66 threats, 14 categories, English.
  Each threat is a rule: `example` = trigger context, `response` = intervention,
  `riskScore = severity × likelihood`.
- **Intervention model:** risk-tiered and policy-driven — `notify` (report) → `justify` (ask) →
  `block` (deny) → `kill` (terminate session). Report-first by default, blocking when configured.

## Architecture

### Mental model — one brain, many eyes (don't re-litigate)
The **harness is a brain, not an eye.** It *decides*; it can only decide about wires it is actually
tapped into. Making it smarter never lets it see a wire it isn't connected to. AI activity crosses
**several wires that never converge** at one point on the device:

| Wire | Where it runs | Tap |
|---|---|---|
| Human ↔ AI (chat: prompts, pastes, uploads, responses) | inside the host webview | **Managed Host** — always |
| AI ↔ tools (agent tool-calls: send email, update CRM, delete file) | model backend / remote MCP server — **never crosses the webview** | **MCP gateway (or API/egress proxy)** — when agents act |
| AI outside the host (other browser, native app, phone) | a different process/device | **browser extension** (shipped) for browser AI; no tap for native apps / phones |
| Deepfake call / vishing | a phone line — no data wire | coach-only (no tap possible) |

**Why MCP is needed (conditionally):** agent tool-calls execute on the AI↔tools wire, which does
not pass through the chat webview, so the harness is *blind* to threats 14/22/23/24/25/38/40 no
matter how capable it is. MCP is the **eye on that second wire** (and the only point where a
tool-call can be deterministically blocked *before* it executes). It is **not a second brain** — it
feeds the same harness.

**The trigger:** harness + host is genuinely enough for *conversational* AI. Add the MCP/proxy tap
**only when agentic tool-use is in scope** — hence it shipped in v3, not the MVP.

**Why not just "see everything" from one tap:** no single tap sees everything. A TLS-intercepting
egress proxy still misses on-device/off-network AI and sees raw bytes without in-app context, so it
cannot replace the harness or the MCP gateway. "See everything" reduces to tapping every wire — the
multi-surface suite. The proxy is therefore an **additional** wire, never the only one.

### Local TLS inspection — permitted, opt-in, never the default
**Local TLS inspection is explicitly permitted** as an optional extra layer, offered during
installation and **off unless the user opts in**. It exists to cover the chat/egress surface the
harness and MCP gateway cannot reach — browser AI, cloud AI desktop apps, and any client that
speaks HTTPS without an integration.

The invariant it must satisfy is **content-free egress, not "never decrypt"**:

- Decryption and classification happen **entirely on the device** (Tier-1 regex → Tier-2 local
  model). The plaintext never leaves the machine.
- **Sending content to a third-party API to classify it is forbidden** — that is the line, and it
  is what separates this from a vendor whose "on-device" DLP calls a cloud model to read your
  prompts. On-device inspection with off-device classification is *not* content-free.
- Only the same redacted signal leaves the device as everywhere else: **category · risk level ·
  keyed one-way hash** (HMAC-SHA-256 under the tenant's enrollment token — see
  `cli/content-hash.mjs`; an unkeyed digest of a small-space value like a phone number or an SSN is
  enumerable and would not be one-way in practice).
- The root CA is generated **locally, per device**, never shared or escrowed, and its installation
  is disclosed and reversible. Uninstall removes it.
- Because the interceptor is **open source (AGPL-3.0)**, this is auditable rather than asserted —
  anyone can verify that no content path leaves the device.

Default posture is unchanged: agent hook + MCP gateway, no certificate, no interception. Local TLS
inspection is the opt-in depth setting for teams that want the extra coverage and accept the
trade-offs (certificate trust, cert-pinning breakage, per-platform network extensions).

### Core principle — MoorAI is a pre-flight egress guard
MoorAI sits **in front of** the agent and reviews what is about to be sent **before** it leaves
for `claude -p` (or any downstream LLM/agent). The review is therefore **local by necessity** —
doing the review *via* a cloud call would itself be the egress we're trying to gate. Local review
(Tier-1 regex → Tier-2 local model) decides allow / redact / abort; only the **approved** prompt
egresses to the agent. This is what dissolves the privacy tension: MoorAI never sends raw content
to the cloud for its own reasoning.

### Components
- **MoorAI Client** — native desktop Managed AI Host (self-installed, voluntary). Hosts the
  managed webview, runs the detection brain locally, coaches the user, reports alerts up.
- **MoorAI Guard (CLI)** — `moorai-guard` wraps `claude -p`: captures the prompt at the submit
  boundary, runs the local review, and forwards only the approved/redacted prompt to the real
  `claude -p`. The runnable proof that the harness reviews egress before the agent. (`npm run guard`.)
- **MoorAI Server** — distributes policy + rule-base to clients, ingests redacted alerts, and serves
  the security-team dashboard. The client's default endpoint is `http://localhost:8787`, overridable
  via the `MoorAI_SERVER` env var or `serverUrl` in the config ([`cli/config.mjs`](../cli/config.mjs)).
  The server does not enforce directly — it distributes the **policy** that drives client-side
  enforcement.

### Client form factor — native Managed AI Host
- Native desktop app (cross-platform from one codebase). All AI tools are reached through the host.
- In-band inspection points: **pre-submit** (prompt), **post-response** (AI output),
  **upload/drag-drop** (files), **paste/clipboard** (into the prompt box).
- *Companion surfaces (shipped):* a browser extension ([`browser-ext/`](../browser-ext/)) to
  **detect** AI use *outside* the host, and an MCP middleware layer
  ([`mcp-proxy/`](../mcp-proxy/)) that guardrails agentic tool-calls.

### Detection brain — tiered escalation cascade
Cheapest-and-most-private first; the escalation order *is* the privacy order.

1. **Tier 1 — deterministic rules** — always on, local, instant, zero egress. Owns the allow/deny
   decision.
2. **Tier 2 — local model** — on ambiguity, opportunistic and policy-gated
   ([`data/model-escalation.mjs`](../data/model-escalation.mjs)). Ollama on the loopback interface
   (`127.0.0.1:11434`, default `llama3.2:1b`) — deliberately not configurable to a remote host, so
   nothing leaves the device. Fail-open: no model, timeout or error yields no verdict and never
   changes enforcement.
3. **Tier 2b — device-side provider inference** — when no local model is present
   ([`data/device-inference.mjs`](../data/device-inference.mjs)). Reuses the API key **already on the
   developer's machine** (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or an admin key file), so no new third party and no new
   egress is introduced. **MoorAI's own cloud never holds an AI credential and never makes the LLM
   call.** No key → fall back to regex-only, fail-open.

There is no MoorAI-hosted inference tier: escalation is local-first, then the developer's own
credential, then nothing.

### Telemetry — redacted alerts only
Client → Server alerts carry **redacted metadata only**: threat id, category, risk tier, timestamp,
tool used, optional keyed content hash / redacted snippet. **Never raw sensitive content** — otherwise
MoorAI would itself commit threats #1 / #9 / #33 on every phone-home.

### Policy — server → client
Server distributes: approved-tools allowlist, risk thresholds, per-threat/per-tier enforcement
actions (`threatPolicy` / `tierPolicy`), model-escalation policy, and rule-base updates. Client
pulls on launch and periodically; works offline against the last-known policy.

## Risk distribution (from the matrix)

Counts are the shipped `riskLevel` labels in `data/threats.json` — the field the engine actually
ranks findings by ([`src/engine.js`](../src/engine.js)) — across all 66 threats.

| Level | Count | Nominal score band |
|---|---|---|
| Critical | 17 | ≥ 20 |
| High | 40 | 12–19 |
| Medium | 9 | 6–11 |

Note: 8 of the 66 threats carry a `riskLevel` label outside the nominal band their `riskScore`
would place them in (e.g. #65 scores 15 but is labeled Critical; #43 scores 6 but is labeled High).
The label wins at runtime; the bands in `meta.scoring` are documentation, not an invariant the data
is validated against.

## Capabilities

### A. Host / gateway (client)
1. **Approved-tools launcher** — the allowlisted AI tools, reached through the host. *Coaches on
   threats 4, 5, 7, 28; when an MCP allow-list is configured, an off-list server is denied outright
   (`checkServer`, [`cli/hook-core.mjs`](../cli/hook-core.mjs)) — but a user who never installs
   MoorAI is still unreached.*
2. **Per-context sessions** — a separate conversation per customer / project / topic. *Threat 36.*

### B. In-band detection (client; mapped to threat clusters)
3. **Sensitive-data guard (DLP)** — pre-submit + paste inspection. *Threats 1, 9, 15, 33, 39.*
4. **Upload guard** — intercepts file uploads / drag-drop. *Threats 18, 27.*
5. **Prompt-injection scanner** — inspects pasted/external content. *Threats 2, 3, 40.*
6. **Output-safety scanner** — dangerous links/scripts/macros + fake sources. *Threats 8, 17, 29, 32, 34, 35.*
7. **Social-engineering / BEC sentinel** — bank-detail/payment/invoice/deepfake patterns. *Threats 10–13, 30, 31.*
8. **Meeting & memory hygiene** — transcription warnings, risky AI-memory writes. *Threats 19, 20, 22.*
9. **Permissions-exposure watch** — over-broad / role-irrelevant results. *Threat 6.*
10. **Ethics check** — human-review nudge on AI-assisted screening. *Threat 16.*
11. **Output-sharing check** — scans summaries/screenshots before sharing. *Threats 20, 37.*

### C. Runtime (client)
12. **Risk-prioritized alerting** — ranks findings by `riskLevel`, then `riskScore` as the tiebreak.
13. **In-context guidance** — surfaces the matching `response` + a source link.
14. **Local audit log** — on-device record of detections/decisions.
15. **Redacted alert reporting** — sends redacted alerts to the server (metadata only).
16. **Policy pull** — fetches allowlist/thresholds/rule-base from the server; offline-tolerant.
17. **Privacy-preserving** — inspection is local; only redacted metadata leaves the device.

### D. Central server
18. **Policy & rule-base distribution** — central allowlist, thresholds, per-threat/per-tier
    enforcement actions, and versioned rule-base pushed to clients.
19. **Alert ingestion** — receives and stores redacted client alerts.
20. **Security dashboard** — org-wide risk view: alerts by threat / category / risk tier / user,
    trends over time. The dashboard itself is **visibility**; enforcement happens on the client,
    driven by the policy this server distributes.

## Intervention tiers (policy-driven)

The action comes from policy, not from the risk level alone — `threatActionFor` resolves
per-threat → data-tier → approval-set → `notify`.

- **`notify`** (the default for an unconfigured threat) → prominent inline warning + the matrix's
  defensive-response text; the call proceeds and the finding is logged + reported.
- **`justify`** → surfaced as Claude Code `ask`: the developer must acknowledge/justify before the
  call proceeds (logged + reported). Default for threats 11, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49.
- **`block`** → Claude Code `deny`; the tool call does not execute.
- **`kill`** → denies the call *and* terminates the session (`killSession`). `killOnCritical`
  promotes any Critical `block` to a `kill` without per-threat configuration.

## Coverage & blind spots

- **Strong, native, in-band** for AI work done *inside* the host.
- **Agentic tool-calls** are covered by the shipped MCP middleware ([`mcp-proxy/`](../mcp-proxy/)),
  and **browser AI** by the companion extension ([`browser-ext/`](../browser-ext/)) — both are the
  taps the "one brain, many eyes" model calls for, and both can deny, not merely observe.
- **Blind spot:** AI use on surfaces with no tap at all — native AI desktop apps without an
  integration, other devices, phones — plus anything on a machine where the user never installed
  MoorAI. Adoption remains voluntary, so the security dashboard reflects *opt-in population* risk,
  not total org risk — a limitation to state plainly to stakeholders.

## Build phasing

- **MVP** — native host shell + approved-tools launcher + Tier-1 rules + pre-submit DLP +
  output-safety + warn-and-override UI, driven by `data/threats.json`. Local audit log.
- **v2** — central server (policy distribution + alert ingestion + dashboard); client policy-pull
  and redacted alert reporting; Tier-2 local model; upload/paste guards; per-context sessions.
- **v3** *(shipped)* — out-of-host detection companion ([`browser-ext/`](../browser-ext/)); MCP
  agentic guardrails ([`mcp-proxy/`](../mcp-proxy/)); on-device model escalation. The Tier-3
  cloud-SDK escalation originally planned here was **dropped**: escalation is local-first, then the
  developer's own on-machine credential, and MoorAI's cloud never makes the LLM call.

## DECIDED

- **Native runtime/toolkit** — **Tauri** (see [`src-tauri/`](../src-tauri/)), chosen over Electron
  for size, auditability and a clean local-model sidecar.
- **Local model** — **nothing is bundled.** Tier 2 is opportunistic: it uses an Ollama model already
  present on the machine (default `llama3.2:1b`), else the developer's own provider credential, else
  regex-only. This keeps the installer small and avoids shipping a model in the notarized build.

## OPEN DECISIONS

- **Server stack** — hosting target and dashboard framework (likely Node + SQLite per AppCrane
  conventions). The client defaults to `http://localhost:8787` until this lands.
